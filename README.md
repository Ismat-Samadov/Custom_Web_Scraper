# Custom_Web_Scraper
Build a custom web scraper to collect data on things that you are interested in.
Certainly! Here's an example of how you can build a custom web scraper using Python and the BeautifulSoup library to collect data on things you are interested in:

1. Set up the project:
   - Create a new directory for your project.
   - Inside the project directory, create a virtual environment by running `python -m venv venv`.
   - Activate the virtual environment:
     - On Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
     - On macOS/Linux: `source venv/bin/activate`
   - Install the required libraries by running `pip install beautifulsoup4 requests`.

2. Import the required modules:
   - Open a new Python file, e.g., `scraper.py`, and import the following modules:

   ```python
   import requests
   from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
   ```

3. Define the scraper function:
   - Create a function that performs the scraping. For example, let's say you're interested in collecting the titles of articles from a news website. Here's a sample function that does that:

   ```python
   def scrape_articles(url):
       # Send a GET request to the URL
       response = requests.get(url)
       
       # Create a BeautifulSoup object to parse the HTML content
       soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')
       
       # Find the elements that contain the article titles
       article_titles = soup.find_all('h2', class_='article-title')
       
       # Extract the text from the article titles
       titles = [title.text.strip() for title in article_titles]
       
       return titles
   ```

4. Run the scraper:
   - In the same `scraper.py` file, you can call the `scrape_articles` function and provide the URL of the website you want to scrape. For example:

   ```python
   if __name__ == '__main__':
       url = 'https://example.com/news'  # Replace with the actual URL
       article_titles = scrape_articles(url)
       for title in article_titles:
           print(title)
   ```

   Replace `'https://example.com/news'` with the URL of the website you want to scrape. You can customize the function and the scraping logic based on the structure and elements of the target website.

   Note: Before scraping a website, make sure to review the website's terms of service and check if they allow scraping. Additionally, be respectful of the website's resources and do not overload their servers with excessive requests.

Remember to adapt the code according to your specific requirements and the structure of the website you want to scrape. Each website may have a different HTML structure, and you may need to adjust the code accordingly to extract the desired data.
